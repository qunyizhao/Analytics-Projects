**Project Introduction: Evaluating Pricing Strategy of Airbnb in Florida 2022**

As the largest online marketplace focused on homestays and experiences, Airbnb provides
customers with a more personalized way for their travel experience. Millions of listings were
put on Airbnb for travelers to choose from. With such a big dataset, our project aims to solve
urgent business problems of Airbnb pricing strategy below:

**(1) Are there any seasonal variabilities in prices and room availability?**
Since room availability and average price are the two most essential factors when Airbnb
customers book different listings. They not only determine the hosts' revenue, but are also
closely related to the benefits of Airbnb â€“ the occupancy (availability) of each listing.

**(2) What features of a listing impact its price?**
Understanding the impact of amenities and services on price can guide new hosts to charge
attractively and allow customers to weigh their preferences when booking.

**(3) Do positive reviews drive prices?**
Understanding the impact of customer feedback can provide valuable insights into property
management, and therefore, prices.

The project can significantly impact Airbnb's new hosts, existing hosts, customers, and
Airbnb itself: Our predictions will give new hosts insights on what important features they
should focus on developing, and what prices to charge without foregoing occupancy. Further,
Airbnb customers will know how to optimize for features given a price. Analyzing reviews
with NLP can also provide insights into managing the quantity v.s. quality of reviews. Airbnb
can share the insights learned from our models by analyzing price and occupancy rates with
their hosts to maximize their profits and reservation rate.
