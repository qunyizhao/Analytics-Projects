# Starbucks Corporation: Leveraging Digital Promotions Data to Enable Effective Targeting

Starbucks interacts with millions of customers worldwide and has immense presence in the market. To facilitate more market presence and frequency of purchases, this project will use Starbucks’ digital promotions data to investigate key aspects that will enable a deeper understanding of consumer reactions of promotions. Our research questions are:

**(1) How successful have each of the offers been and what aspects of the offer type contributed to said success?**

**(2) What are the emergent customer segments based on offer reception and usage?**

Studying these aspects will help Starbucks fine-tune their promotional strategy and offer formulation in a way that reaches out to the right customer, and result in an increased purchase frequency. For customers, receiving a personalized offer will not only boost purchases but also increase loyalty to the brand in the expectation that the brand is cognizant of the customer as an individual and values him/her enough to fine-tune promotions and offers. We expect the offer types to be distinct, aimed at a rather differentiated customer base with a wide variety of reactions – which we explore and dissect through this project.
